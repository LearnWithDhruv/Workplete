# AI Employee Prototype

## Overview
This project is a prototype for an AI employee that specializes in data analysis and reporting. The AI employee can process large datasets, identify trends, and generate insightful reports for clients. The prototype is designed to handle multiple file formats, perform data preprocessing, apply machine learning algorithms, and generate comprehensive reports with visualizations.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Supports CSV, JSON, and Excel file formats.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes data for analysis.
- **Analysis Engine:** Implements statistical and machine learning algorithms to extract insights.
- **Report Generation:** Creates detailed reports with charts, graphs, and summaries.
- **User Interaction:** Includes a command-line interface with basic natural language processing.
